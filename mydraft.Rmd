# Problem

To propose a suitable site for the relocation of the Indonesian capital. A suitable site would satisfy multiple factors including:

* Size
  + Area between 4500 to 5500 hectares
* Safety
  + Away from potential natural disaster risk areas like sea coasts and major rivers
  + Not in areas prone to forest fire
* Accessibility
  + Highly accessible by roads
  + Close proximity to airports and seaports
* Ease of development
  + Avoid steep slopes
  + Avoid natural forest
  + Near current existing settlement but not at current major settlement

## Motivation

Jakarta, the sinking city, is experiencing first-hand the effects of rising sea levels. Additionally, it also suffers from overpopulation that burdens its water piping system. This forces residents to pump water from underground, further lowering the city foundations. A new capital will ease the overcrowding and thus the sinking of the current sea-side capital Jakarta.

# Methods

This package uses the same workflow approach as the R Markdown you know and love. Basically it goes from RMarkdown > Knitr > Markdown > Pandoc > HTML/CSS > PDF. You can even use the bibliography the same way [@R-posterdown].

# Results

Usually you want to have a nice table displaying some important results that you have calculated. In `posterdown` this is as easy as using the `kable` table formatting you are probably use to as per typical R Markdown formatting.

You can reference tables like so: Table \@ref(tab:mytable). Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam placerat augue at velit tincidunt semper. Donec elementum porta posuere. Nullam interdum, odio at tincidunt feugiat, turpis nisi blandit eros, eu posuere risus felis non quam. Nam eget lorem odio. Duis et aliquet orci. Phasellus nec viverra est.

```{r mytable, out.width='80%'}
knitr::kable(iris[1:10, 1:4], caption = 'Table caption.',align = 'c',"html")
```

Or with figures: Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot), or Figure \@ref(fig:morefigs).

```{r standard-plot, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Great figure!', fig.height=5}
plot(mtcars[1:2])
```

```{r morefigs, out.width='80%', echo=TRUE, fig.cap='Amazing, right?!', fig.height=5}
data <- iris

plot(x = data$Sepal.Length, 
     y = data$Sepal.Width, 
     col = data$Species,
     pch = 19, 
     xlab = "Sepal Length (cm)",
     ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)")

```

# Next Steps

Aliquam sed faucibus risus, quis efficitur erat. Vestibulum semper mauris quis tempus eleifend. Aliquam sagittis dictum ipsum, quis viverra ligula eleifend ut. Curabitur sagittis vitae arcu eget faucibus. In non elementum felis. Duis et aliquam nunc. Nunc pulvinar sapien nunc, vel pretium nisi efficitur in. Fusce fringilla maximus leo et maximus. Fusce at ligula laoreet, iaculis mi at, auctor odio. Praesent sed elementum justo. Aenean consectetur risus rhoncus tincidunt efficitur. Praesent dictum mauris at diam maximus maximus [@R-posterdown].
