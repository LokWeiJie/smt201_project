# 1.0	About the Project

In 2019, during his annual state of the union address at the parliament, President Joko Widodo announced a plan to relocate the capital of Jakarta to more than 1,000km away to the province of East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. 

After in-depth studies conducted by the government, it is concluded that the capital is best built in part of North Penajam Paser Regency (Kabupaten Penajam Utara) and part of Kutai Kertanegara Regency (Kabupaten Kutai Kartanegara) in East Kalimantan. 

The plan is part of a strategy to reduce developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago and to reduce Jakarta’s burden as Indonesia’s primary hub.

## 1.1	Project Objectives
  
There are 2 main objectives:

1. Report of Survey and GIS of proposed capital area

2. Site selection of new capital site

### 1.1.1	Report of Survey and building of GIS

The province of East Kalimantan, specifically the districts of Kota Balipapan, Kota Samarinda, and selected kecamatan (districts) and sub-districts of North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara Regencies will be surveyed and be used to build a GIS.

The GIS and survey will focus on the following aspects:

* Population and Demographic

* Economic and Businesses

* Transport and Communication

* Infrastructure

* Environment and Hazard

### 1.1.2	Site Selection of new capital site

The new capital site will be selected based on its suitability through GIS analysis. This new site will adhere to the following criteria:

* It should be between 4500-5500 hectares in size

* It should avoid steep slope. Steep slope developments are relative more costly because they involve cut-and-fill and is less environmental friendly.

* It should be away from potential natural disaster risk areas such as sea coasts, major rivers and volcanoes.

* It should be near to current urban settlement areas but not at the current major settlement areas.

* It should avoid natural forest as much as possible.

* It should avoid areas prone to forest fire.

* It should be highly accessible via road transport.

* It should be near to airport(s) and seaport(s).
