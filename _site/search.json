For example, AGRIKEBUN in the Penajam Paser Utara regency would be named penajam_agriculture. Ensure that the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 - DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 before saving.\r\n3.0 Extraction of study area\r\nAdd in the Batas_Desa_Desember_2019_Dukcapil_Kalimantan_Timur layer, and open its attribute table. Click on select features by expression.\r\n\r\nUse the following expression:\r\n\r\n“KECAMATAN” in ( ‘ANGGANA’ , ‘BABULU’ , ‘LOA JANAN’ , ‘LOA KULU’ , ‘MARANG KAYU’ , ‘MUARA BADAK’ , ‘MUARA JAWA’ , ‘PENAJAM’ , ‘SAMBOJA’ , ‘SANGA SANGA’ , ‘SEBULU’ , ‘TENGGARONG’ , ‘TENGGARONG SEBERANG’ , ‘SEPAKU’ , ‘WARU’ ) or “KAB_KOTA” in ( ‘KOTA BALIKPAPAN’, ‘KOTA SAMARINDA’ )\r\n\r\n\r\nClick on select features.\r\nOnce the features are selected, right click on the layer and select Export > Export Selected Features As. Save in the kalimantan geopackage and name this layer Study_Area_dgn. Ensure that the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 - DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 before saving.\r\n4.0 Clipping of layers\r\nThere are a few layers that need to be clipped to within our study area.\r\n4.1 DEM\r\nImport the DEM raster layer. Click on clip raster by extent under raster → extraction. Set input layer as DEM SRTM 30M Kalimantan Timur. Under clipping extent, select calculate from layer, select Study_Area_dgn.\r\n\r\nClick on ok. A new clipped raster layer is created.\r\nSave this layer into the Kalimantan geopackage, naming it dem_clipped. Ensure that the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 - DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 before saving.\r\n4.2 Dissolving of study area\r\nDissolve layer is similar to union but in this everything is merged by the common field and it works on a single layer. To do that open the tool from Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Dissolve. You assign the Input Vector layer on the Study_Area and click run.\r\n\r\nOnce the output layer is created. Right click on the layer and select Save feature as. Click on save into the kalimantan Geopackage and ensure that the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 - DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 before saving.\r\n\r\n4.3 Clipping of other layers\r\nThere are some layers that have data outside of our study area. We need to ensure that all our layers only have information that is within our study area. We will be using the Clip function. For this example, I will be using the Street_LN layer under our Penajam folder. Click on Vector → Geoprocessing Tools → Clip. Select the Street_LN layer as the input layer and Dissolved Study Area as the Overlay layer.\r\n\r\nFor both the layers, ensure that you have chosen the Do not filter(better performance) as the Invalid feature filtering. Click on Run.\r\n\r\nA new clipped raster layer is created. Right click on the clipped layer and select Export and Save features as. Click on OK. Save this layer into the Kalimantan geopackage, naming it dem_clipped. Ensure that the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 - DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 before saving.\r\nRepeat the steps for other layers that have unwanted data points outside our study area, continuing with the naming convention of original_layer_name_clipped as the name of the new clipped layer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

A suitable site would satisfy multiple factors including:\r\nSize\r\nArea between 4500 to 5500 hectares\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nAway from potential natural disaster risk areas like sea coasts and major rivers\r\nNot in areas prone to forest fire\r\n\r\nAccessibility\r\nHighly accessible by roads\r\nClose proximity to airports and seaports\r\n\r\nEase of development\r\nAvoid steep slopes\r\nAvoid natural forest\r\nNear current existing settlement but not at current major settlement\r\n\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\nJakarta, the sinking city, is experiencing first-hand the effects of rising sea levels. Additionally, it also suffers from overpopulation that burdens its water piping system. This forces residents to pump water from underground, further lowering the city foundations. A new capital will ease the overcrowding and thus the sinking of the current sea-side capital Jakarta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApproach\r\nThe following geospatial analysis techniques were used in our project:\r\nMCDA, AHP, Reclassification by table, Raster Calculator, Clipping, Polygonizing, Rasterize, Merging Vector Layer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nFig 1: MCDA Output\r\n\r\nWe decided that the slope factor is the most important factor to note when choosing our site. Thus we used the map above as our base map. The areas that are spotty are steeper than 15 degrees and thus an area with high concentration of spots would be unfit for our site. We analyzed the area using our four factors mentioned in issue analysis to choose our site.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommendation\r\n\r\nFig 2: Selected Site\r\n\r\nAfter much consideration, this area that is shaded in a rectangle is our recommendation for the new capital city. It is 4723 hectares in size and while, is not near the major urban settlement in Balikpapan, is near other existing small settlements. This site selection satisfies our size objective since it is between 4500 to 5500 hectares.\r\n\r\nFig 3: Forest hotspots\r\n\r\nTo satisfy our objective of safety, we avoided areas that are forest fire hotspots and ensured the recommended location was not along the coast or besides major rivers to avoid flooding.\r\n\r\nFig 4: Air+Seaports\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 5: Air+Seaports\r\n\r\nTo satisfy our objective of accessibility, the new capital must be accessible by roads. In the previous map, Land Suitability Map with Air and Sea Ports we can also see there is a major highway running through our site, providing ease of transport. The major highway also connects our site to highways and it is positioned in close proximity to harbours.\r\n\r\nFig 6: Forests\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 7: Existing Settlements\r\n\r\nOur chosen site does not overlap much with heavy forests and is also near other settlements while not being situated at a major settlement itself. Both of these in conjunction with the slope layer show ease of development for our site.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Plans\r\nIn the future, it is possible to expand our scope of issues and factors that contribute to a suitable site. This could include things such as avoiding agricultural areas as well as being in proximity to worship areas based on local demographics for greater quality of life in the capital. It is also possible to expand our toolkit to use a 3D representation of slope to get a better understanding of the land layout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Additionally, it has its own unique problem. The segregation and overpopulation in Jakarta further burden the already uneven water piping system and thus cause a structural restriction of water to most of its residents. This forces them to source water from pumping groundwater.\r\nWith large amounts of groundwater being pumped, the city’s foundations have been lowered with some places sinking over four meters in the last twenty years [2]. Moving the capital and its population with it would ease the strain on the water piping system and thus reduce the need for pumping groundwater, stabilizing the problem.\r\n Source: The Asean Post [3]\r\n1.1 Project Objectives\r\nTo do a thorough investigation of East Kalimantan with the intention of finding the best location for the new capital. The new location should be sizable, safe, accessible and easy to develop.\r\n1.2 Scope\r\nBy making use of QGIS software and data gathered from Indonesia Geospasial we plan to analyse each of the previously mentioned categories.\r\nThese categories are:\r\nSizable\r\nArea between 4500 to 5500 hectares\r\n\r\nSafe\r\nAway from potential natural disaster risk areas like sea coasts and major rivers\r\nNot in areas prone to forest fire\r\n\r\nAccessible\r\nHighly accessible by roads\r\nClose proximity to airports and seaports\r\n\r\nEase of development\r\nAvoid steep slopes\r\nAvoid natural forest\r\nNear current existing settlement but not at current major settlements\r\n\r\n2.0 Project Milestones\r\n\r\n3.0 References\r\n[1] https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/indonesia-move-capital-sinking-jakarta-borneo-n1046651\r\n[2] https://www.vox.com/22295302/why-jakarta-sinking-flooding-colonialism\r\n[3] The Asean Post https://theaseanpost.com/article/indonesias-new-capital-hold-due-pandemic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The following steps will be reproducible to merge the other layers together. Firstly, ensure that you have the 2 following layers, “Titik Api Hotspot se-Indonesia Tahun 2018.shp” and “Titik Api Hotspot se-Indonesia Tahun 2019.shp” Next, go to Vectors -> Data Management Tools -> Merge Vector Layers… and choose the 2 hotspot layers as your input layers and run it.\r\n\r\nOnce the output is created, right click on the output layer and select the open attribute table. Click on the pencil icon on the corner left to toggle editing and select open field calculator, which is the 4th icon from the right.\r\n\r\nEnsure that the Create a new field is checked. Put POI_Code as the Output field name and 1 as the expression. This column will be used for burn-in values(if any).\r\n\r\nNext, select Delete field, which is the 6th icon from the right. Select the fid field to be deleted.\r\n\r\nOnce done, save the changes and save the layer into the kalimantan geopackage, named HotSpot_18_19_Merged. Ensure that the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 - DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 before saving.\r\nRepeat these steps to merge all the airports and seaports into 1 layer as well as all the forest within the study area into another layer. Name them Air_Sea_Ports_Merged and Forest_Merged respectively.\r\n2.0 Rasterizing the layers\r\nFrom the menu bar of QGIS, select Processing -> Toolbox. The processing toolbox pane appears on the right side of the Map View window.\r\n\r\nFrom the Geoprocessing Toolbox, click on GDAL -> Vector conversion -> Rasterize (vector to raster). The dialog window appears. Use the following parameters:\r\nInput layer: HotSpot_18_19_Merged.\r\nField to use for a burn in value: POI_CODE\r\nOutput raster size units: Georeferenced units\r\nWidth/Horizontal resolution: 50\r\nHeight/Vertical resolution: 50\r\nOutput extent, select Calculate from layer -> Geopackaged Dissolved Study Area Your Screen should look something similar to the figure below\r\n\r\nClick the Run button. A new raster layer will be created. Using the steps from before, save the raster into the kalimantan geopackage and name it Rasterized_HotSpots. Ensure that the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 - DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 before saving. Repeat the steps for all the other layers.\r\n2.1 Creating proximity layer\r\nFrom the Processing Toolbox panel, search for Proximity(raster distance), under GDAL. Double click on it. Use the following parameters: * Input layer: Rasterized_HotSpots * Distance units:Georeferenced coordinates The dialog should look somewhat similar to this.\r\n\r\nClick on the Run button. A new proximity map will be added. To observe how it works, check your hotspot layer and your proximity layer. Zoom into the study area and right click on the proximity layer and select Stretch Using current Extent which will give you a clearer view. Using the steps from earlier, save this into the kalimantan geopackage and name the layer *Proximity_Hotspot. Ensure that the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 - DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 before saving. Repeat this process for all the other layers.\r\n3.0 Raster-based GIS Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDA)\r\nAs all the factors have different scales upon which criteria is measured, it is necessary that factors are standardized before combination using the formula below:\r\n We will be standardizing the maps by using the Raster Calculator function of GQIS. Take note of the maximum and minimum of the Proximity HotSpot, which can be done by double-clicking on the layer and scrolling down the Information tab. It should look something like this.\r\n For Proximity_Hotspot, the maximum is 88631.007812500 while the minimum is 0. Next, at the Search pane of Geoprocessing Toolbox, panel, type raster calculator. We will be utilizing the Raster Calculator of Raster Analysis. Double-click on it. The dialog window of the Raster calculator appears. At the layers panel, double click on Proximity_HotSpot layer. Under the Expression, fill up the standardizing formula. Choose Proximity_Hotspot as the Reference layer and it should look something like this.\r\n\r\nClick Run. Once the output is finished, save the layer as into the kalimantan geopackage and name it Factorised_HotSpot.\r\nRepeat these steps for all the factors.\r\n3.1 AHP Analysis\r\nUsing the excel sheet provided by SBC Associates, list down all the 7 different factors on the rows. We have determined the importance of each factor according to the rating on the left side of the excel sheet as seen here.\r\n\r\nEnsure that the consistency check is below 10% for it to be a good evaluation.\r\nNow, we will compute the Land Suitability Layer by using the factor score derived above. Using the raster calculator of QGIS, we will be using this expression:\r\n\r\n“Factorised_Slope@1” * 0.247 + “Factorised_HotSpot@1” * 0.221 + “Factorized_River@1” * 0.192 + “Factorized_Forest@1”0.115 + “Factorised_Road@1” 0.083+\"Factorised_Port@1“* 0.071 +”Factor_major_settlement\r\n\r\nClick on run. A new recalculated raster layer is created. Export and save this into the kalimantan geopackage, name it AHP_suitability. Ensure that the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 - DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 before saving.\r\n4.0 Identifying suitable sites\r\nOnce the MCDA model is done, we used a composite factor score of at least 0.55 to evaluate site suitability, based on our current raster band.To do this, we will open up Toolbox ->Search for Reclassify by table.\r\n\r\nClick on the 3 dots next to Reclassification table.\r\n\r\nClick on Add Row twice then fill up the table as shown below then click OK.\r\n\r\nEnsure that the output data type is Float32. Click on run.\r\nThe MCDA model should look something like this:\r\n\r\nWe will then save it as MCDA_model into the kalimantan geopackage. Ensure that the CRS is set to EPSG:23845 - DGN95 / Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1 before saving.\r\n4.1 Vectorise suitable sites\r\nFrom the menu bar, select Raster -> Conversion -> Polygonize(Raster to Vector). Use the following parameters:\r\nInput Layer: AHP_capitalcity\r\nName of the field to create: Sites.\r\nEnsure that Use 8-connectedness is unchecked.\r\nClick on run. A new temporary layer called Vectorized will be added as shown below.\r\n\r\nOnly sites which are given the value of 1 in the attribute table on this layer are considered suitable. Right click on the layer and select Attribute Table > Select by Expression write “Sites” = 1 as shown below.\r\n\r\nClick Select features. Then right click on the layer again. Select Export > Save selected features as and save this into the kalimantan geopackage, naming it Vectoriesed_SelectedFeature.\r\nThe newly saved layer should look like this:\r\n\r\n5.0 Site Suitability Analysis\r\n\r\nAfter much consideration and discussion, we have decided to propose for the new capital city to be in this area of East Kalimantan. After taking into consideration all factors. The reason why it looks like it is so spotty is because of the slope factor, which we gave the highest importance to. Since building a new capital city will be so costly, we decided to choose this spot as it is one of the areas that have the most level ground relative to the other suitable areas of the study area. The rectangle, which is the estimated size of the proposed city area, is around 4726 hectares.\r\n\r\nAs observed, there are a few large forested areas around our proposed site selection. However, there is not a large area that will be needed to be deforested to make way for the new city. There are also many advantages of having a large forested area near a city as it brings around a lot of cooling effects.\r\n\r\nThe proposed site is generally far away from all the hotspots that happened around the area in 2018 and 2019.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt can be seen that the capital city is definitely accessible by the roads (blue in colour). From the map with the OSM layer, the yellow line is a major roadway then goes across the major rivers and to the airports and Balikpapan’s major urban settlement. This makes the capital highly accessible as it is near the major roadway that essentially spans across the entire East Kalimantan. The proposed city, while near small rivers are not near any major river. Having rivers near the city is beneficial because it brings in economic benefits such as tourism, boating as well as fishing.\r\n\r\nThe map above shows how there are 2 ports, north of the proposed city location as well as 2 on the east side of it. It is very accessible to all the 4 ports near it. The major freeway (in yellow) actually passes through the capital city. It also goes across the major river towards the airport. While it is not very convenient, having a major freeway to bring you directly to the airport is considered accessible. Additionally, having an airport very close to you is also not good. It disrupts education as well as has long term side effects. It also over long periods of time, makes buildings weaker. Given that this was a multi-criteria decision analysis, this was the best area for a capital city.\r\n\r\nThe map shows some of the existing settlements around the proposed area. It is good that while it is not near a current major urban settlement at Balikpapan, there are a few other small settlements around it. Having some settlements around the area is beneficial for those living there as it will improve their quality of life. They will have more job opportunities as well as an opportunity to sell the land their homes are on for companies to build urban homes for a very large profit. This is because the value of land increases tremendously when there are major projects in the nearby areas. This way, they will have an increased quality of life since their wealth has also increased tremendously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Rename these two layers into Population and Work_Pop respectively.\r\n1.1 General Population Choropleth Map\r\nFor Population layer, right click on the layer and select Properties… > Symbology. Change the symbol type from Simple Symbol to Graduated then under value select Jumlah_Pen which is the population data.\r\nSelect Blues under colour ramp then select Classify > Equal Count (Quantile) to see the Classes box get populated. After that click Apply > OK to get the choropleth map of the general population of the study area. The map should look something like this:\r\n\r\n1.1.1 Analysis\r\nFrom the choropleth map above, the general population density of East Kalimantan matches more urbanised areas, being much denser in mainly the two cities Kota Balikpapan and Samarinda, not just at the city centres but in nearby desa (sub-districts) around the cities. There is also a relatively high population density in the Penajam Paser Utara regency, corresponding to the settlement there.\r\n1.2 Working Population Choropleth Map\r\nFor Work_Pop first right click on the layer and go to Attribute Table then click Edit > Open Field Calculator.\r\n\r\nIn Indonesia the working population is from age 20 to 65 so we shall use those data points from the attribute to create a new row. Enter Work_Pop into the output field name and select the following data points from Fields and Values to create the expression below before pressing OK.\r\n\r\nAfter that follow similar steps as the Population layer but when selecting the value in symbology, select Work_pop instead and continue to follow the steps to generate the choropleth map.\r\n\r\n1.2.1 Analysis\r\nFrom the choropleth map generated above, it is clear that similar to the general population, the majority of the working population in East Kalimantan mainly reside in the Kota Balikpapan and Samarinda cities. From the legend we can also see that the working population is generally around half the total population in each area.\r\n1.3 Saving maps\r\nTo create a map layout, click on Project > Layout Manager > Create. Then name the map accordingly. After that hover over Add Items then add Scale Bar, Label, Map and Legend.\r\n\r\nAfter this select Layout > Export as Image > Save to save the map as a file on your computer.\r\n2.0 Economic and Businesses\r\nA total of 3 maps will be created for economic and business:\r\nHealthcare Services\r\nEducation\r\nGovernment buildings and others\r\nFirst, create a new group on the left under the layer column, this is to create a neater workspace. Right click on the Layers column and select Create new group.\r\nNext, using the layers related to Economic and Businesses mentioned in our data preparations, categorise the layers into Healthcare Services, Government and Industry as well as Education Services. Use these three categories along with Study_Area_dgn and OpenStreetMap to create their respective maps. Right click on Study_Area_dgn and then click on Properties > Symbology > Simple Fill. Then under Fill Style, choose No Brush. This will make the map transparent to allow you to see the other layers more clearly. After this you can proceed to save the maps using Layout Manager.\r\n2.1 Healthcare services\r\n\r\nFrom the map generated above we can see the health services are clustered around Kota Balikpapan and Samarinda cities. This is also where the majority of the total population in the study area reside so there is justification in the clusters.\r\n2.2 Education\r\n\r\nFrom the map generated above we can see the education services are clustered around Kota Balikpapan and Samarinda cities. This is also where the majority of the total population in the study area reside so there is justification in the clusters.\r\n2.3 Government Buildings and others\r\n\r\nFrom the map generated above we can see the government buildings are clustered around Kota Balikpapan and Samarinda cities. This is also where the majority of the total population in the study area reside so there is justification in the clusters.\r\n3.0 Transport and Communication\r\nThere are 2 maps in this section:\r\nTransport\r\ncommunication\r\n3.1 Layer union\r\nFirst separate the data mentioned in the dataset into two categories, Transport Infrastructure and Communications respectively. Using all of the Street_LN layers, select Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Union. Select the required layers to combine all the streets together. After each combination, use Union again with the created layer and another Street_LN layer. The first step is shown below.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, continue to follow the steps detailed in the first map by adding the required layers in order to get the Transport Infrastructure map.\r\nFor the Communications map, add in the required layers as well similar to the previous maps then save both maps using the Layout Manager function.\r\n3.2 Transport\r\n\r\nTransport systems in the study area consist of road networks as well as infrastructure that enable travel such as harbours, bus terminals and airports. The road networks cover the majority of the study area while the infrastructure is concentrated around Kota Balikpapan and Samarinda cities. This reflects current world affairs where Balikpapan is known for being a port city.\r\n3.3 Communication\r\n\r\nFor communication systems we have decided to only include phone towers. There is heavy concentration of such infrastructure around Samarinda with others spread around the rest of the study area. Besides Kota Balikpapan and Samarinda Cities, the infrastructure does not correlate to the general population in the study area.\r\n4.0 Infrastructure\r\nFor infrastructure, there are a total of 10 maps, separated by their regency. These are:\r\nKota Balikpapan\r\nKutai Kartanegara\r\nPenajam Paser Utara\r\nKota Samarinda\r\nSimilar to the previous maps, separate the points in the Infrastructure dataset by location as well as roads and their respective buildings to be used. After that add them to their respective maps. Follow the steps above in order to create each map and then save them using the Layout Manager.\r\n4.1 Kota Balikpapan\r\n\r\nGeneral map of all infrastructure in Balikpapan.\r\n\r\nWith removal of the road line, the map becomes a lot cleaner and easier for analysis. We can see a concentration of infrastructure around Kota Balikpapan but at the same time we also see multiple infrastructures closely following the runway line in the area as well as other major roads highlighted by the open street map.\r\n\r\n4.2 Kutai Kartanegara\r\n\r\nThis map shows the locations of the existing settlements in the district of Kutai Kartanegara. It is rather obvious that the settlements are mostly in the port city of Kota Balikpapan as well as the mining city of Samarinda. There is an abundance of job opportunities here compared to the other areas in East Kalimantan.\r\n\r\n4.3 Penajam Paser Utara\r\n\r\nGeneral infrastructure of land roads in Penajam Paser Utara.\r\n\r\nThis map shows the existing settlement in Penajam Paser Utara. The settlement can be considered a self-reliant community because it has the basic infrastructure to support itself such as a gas station, a post office, government offices, tv transmitter towers, worship places as well as hospitals. There are enough amenities for the settlement to be self-sustaining.\r\n4.4 Kota Samarinda\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a city to run efficiently, it has to have some important buildings in it. For example, in Samarinda, there is a post office, a radio station, tv station as well as terminals for buses. There are also bridges and airport runways to connect the city with the rest of the world. For a country like Indonesia where natural disasters quite frequently, it is vital to have a radio station to relay important information to citizens in the event of an emergency, when cell phones and electrical as well as network towers are deemed useless.\r\n\r\nGenerally, from the map generated, the worship locations are quite clustered in the city of Samarinda. With most of the population being Malay-Muslims, most of these points are mosques, while the rest of the locations are mostly churches and Buddhist temples. With more than 230 out of 284 worship places being Mosques, it puts into perspective the high proportion of Muslims in the population.\r\n5.0 Environment and Hazards\r\nFor environment and hazards, there are a total of 8 maps separated by regency. These are:\r\nKota Balikpapan\r\nKutai Kartanegara\r\nPenajam Paser Utara\r\nKota Samarinda\r\nFor Environments and Hazards, separate the data by location as well as into categories such as water hazards, natural and land hazards and below sea level respectively. From here follow the steps mentioned before to populate the maps with their respective data points then save the maps using Layout Manager.\r\n5.1 Kota Balikpapan\r\n\r\nFor Kota Balikpapan, it can be seen that there is an extensive river system that runs throughout the regency, leading to the ocean. There are a few small lakes spread across the regency, as well as one major swamp area northwest from the city.\r\n\r\nMost of the agricultural areas lie relatively far away from the city centre, mainly along the coast in the outer settlements and north of the city. Additionally, there is very little non-arable land in this regency, but most of the land constitutes to overgrown vegetation, even within the city itself.\r\n5.2 Kutai Kartanegara\r\n\r\n\r\nThe map above shows the locations of arable land where farming is occurring in East Kalimantan, specifically, Kutai Kartanegara. With so much land dedicated to agriculture, it is essential that these arable lands are left untouched in order for there to be food security for the people living in the nearby regions. In a recent paper[1], it shows how 82.28% of villages in Kutai Kartanegara are food secure. A new capital city, in order to be a good one needs to have a strong network for food resources.\r\n The layer “shrubs_clipped” actually displays the areas of Kutai Kartanegara where there is dense vegetation [2]. With a lot of corruption, involvement of political agenda and the creation of the North Kalimantan province, the percentage of forested area has dropped from 35% to 15% of the total area in the province. The capital cannot be built on top of dense forests but should also be in the range of some. Forests are in fact essential within cities, they reduce urban temperature, purify the air and provide habitats for local wildlife [3]. Forests in the vicinity also prevent flooding, which is especially important considering that being the primary reason for the new capital selection.\r\n5.3 Penajam Paser Utara\r\n Generally, of the districts and sub-districts of Penajam Paser Utara regency within the study area, most of the agriculture is done near the settlement in the bottom left of the study area. As we go further up north, there are fewer agricultural areas, being replaced with more rivers and natural forests and shrubs.\r\n5.4 Kota Samarinda\r\n\r\nAs for Samarinda, one of the main defining features of this regency is the Mahakam River, the second longest river in Indonesia that runs through the port city of Samarinda[4]. The river itself is surrounded by large areas of dry vegetation as well as non-arable land. The river remains an important part of the ecosystem and economy of Samarinda, supporting many different endemic and protected species, as well as providing river transportation for commercial activities.\r\nHowever, due to the extensive coal mining operations and deforestation carried out along the river, it has become highly polluted. Furthermore, as deforestation and coal mining have loosen the soil around the river and caused erosion, there has been a drastic increase in the number of floods around the river and into the city itself, disrupting economic activities and destroying commercial and residential infrastructure, affecting up to 50,000 people a year, with up to 5 to 6 floods a year.\r\n\r\nFor agriculture in Samarinda, most of it lies far from the city centre and away from the Mahakam River, likely due to concerns from floods.\r\n\r\nThis map that indicates the areas of East Kalimantan that are below mean sea level is an important factor because of the location of Indonesia as a whole [5]. Indonesia sits along the “Pacific Ring of Fire”. This actually means that Indonesia is at a location where several tectonic plates meet and converge. When tectonic plates converge, it results in the formation of earthquakes which often trigger tsunamis. Thus, it is important to note that these places are at risk areas because with global warming, mean sea level is slowly rising.\r\n6.0 References\r\n[1] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322015716_Food_insecurity_as_a_basis_for_drafting_a_Strategic_Food_Sovereignty_Plan_A_case_study_of_the_Kutai_Kartanegara_District_Indonesia\r\n[2] https://news.mongabay.com/2013/02/indonesias-east-kalimantan-loses-forest-area-to-new-province-in-borneo/\r\n[3] https://cities4forests.com/forests/#:~:text=Trees%20and%20forests%20are%20essential%20to%20cities%20and%20their%20residents.&text=Trees%20and%20natural%20areas%20within,and%20provide%20habitat%20for%20wildlife.\r\n[4] https://globalwaterforum.org/2020/10/23/the-story-of-mahakam-river-in-indonesia-from-the-commons-to-extractivism-and-back/\r\n[5] https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/ring-fire/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
