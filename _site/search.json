This new site will adhere to the following criteria:\r\nIt should be between 4500-5500 hectares in size\r\nIt should avoid steep slope. Steep slope developments are relative more costly because they involve cut-and-fill and is less environmental friendly.\r\nIt should be away from potential natural disaster risk areas such as sea coasts, major rivers and volcanoes.\r\nIt should be near to current urban settlement areas but not at the current major settlement areas.\r\nIt should avoid natural forest as much as possible.\r\nIt should avoid areas prone to forest fire.\r\nIt should be highly accessible via road transport.\r\nIt should be near to airport(s) and seaport(s).\r\n2.0 Project Milestones\r\n\r\n3.0 References\r\nThe Asean Post https://theaseanpost.com/article/indonesias-new-capital-hold-due-pandemic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
