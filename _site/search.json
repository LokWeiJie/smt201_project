After in-depth studies conducted by the government, it is concluded that the capital is best built in part of North Penajam Paser Regency (Kabupaten Penajam Utara) and part of Kutai Kertanegara Regency (Kabupaten Kutai Kartanegara) in East Kalimantan.\r\nThe plan is part of a strategy to reduce developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago and to reduce Jakarta’s burden as Indonesia’s primary hub.\r\n1.1 Data Preparation\r\nTwo GIS data are available for the analysis. They are:\r\nLocation of primary, secondary, mixed and JC (i.e. Education).\r\nOutline map of Singapore (i.e. CoastalOutline).\r\n1.1.1 Add the GIS data into QGIS Project\r\nBefore you can start to perform any analysis, you need to start a new QGIS project.\r\n\r\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from last lesson, add the Education and CoastalOutline into the newly created QGIS project.\r\n\r\n1.1.2 Using attribute query to select a subset from a master layer\r\nThe Education layer consists of locations of education institutions such as primary schools, secondary school, mixed and JC. We are only interested on education institutions that belong to primary and secondary schools.\r\n\r\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned from last lesson, extract and save the primary and secondary schools in two separate GIS vector layers.\r\n\r\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\r\n\r\n2.0 Raster Data Modelling\r\nIn this exercise, you will learn how to model raster data. The exercise focusses on how to rasterise a vector GIS data layer using QGIS geoprocessing functions.\r\n2.1 Editing attribute data\r\nIn this section, you will create a new field in the attribute table of a vector GIS data and update values of the newly created field. You will name the field as POI_CODE. The data type of this data field is integer.\r\nAt Browser panel, right-click on the Primary Schools layer. Select Open Attribute Table from the context menu.\r\nThe Attribute table dialog window of Primary Schools appears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
